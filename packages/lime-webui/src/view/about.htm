LibreMesh is an initiative undertaken by community networks members of several continents that collaborate
towards a common goal: to develop a set of tools that facilitate the deployment of Free Networks on any community in the world.
</p>

<p>
Main tool is LibreMesh firmware: based on OpenWrt, eases the creation of WiFi communities, and enables
existing communities to add roaming clouds to their networks.
