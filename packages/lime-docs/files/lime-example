# The /etc/config/lime-defaults file contains the default configuration.
# To configure LibreMesh insert options in /etc/config/lime-node or /etc/config/lime-community file, these will override the default ones.
# Interface specific options have to be included in /etc/config/lime-node, if in /etc/config/lime-community they'll cause unpredictable behaviour.
#
# The options marked with "Parametrizable with %Mn, %Nn, %H"
# can include %Mn templates that will be substituted
# with the n'th byte of the primary_interface MAC
# and %Nn templates that will be replaced by the n'th (n = 1,2,3) network-identifier byte,
# calculated from the hash of the ap_ssid value, so that all the nodes that
# form a mesh cloud (share the same ap_ssid) will produce the same value
# and %H template that will be replaced by hostname
# For setting a specific WAN port, don't set it globally in section "config lime network", set it in interface specific configuration "config net ..." and install the lime-proto-wan package
# For setting the WAN port on the default WAN port (according OpenWRT), just install the lime-hwd-openwrt-wan package and the configuration will be autogenerated.

### System options

config lime system
	option hostname 'LiMe-%M4%M5%M6'		# Parametrizable with %Mn
	option domain 'lan'				# DNS domain for the L2 cloud it could be something like mycloud.mynetwork.tld, hosts that get their IP by DHCP will also get a fully qualified domain name like hostname.mycloud.mynetwork.tld
	option keep_on_upgrade 'libremesh base-files-essential /etc/sysupgrade.conf'	# Files defining the list of files and directories to backup when upgrade. Relative to /lib/upgrade/keep.d if no '/' defined.

### Network general option

config lime network
	option primary_interface eth0			# The mac address of this device will be used in different places
	option main_ipv4_address '10.%N1.0.0/16'	# Here you have 4 possibilities: set a static IP and the subnet, like '10.0.2.1/16'; parametrize with %Mn and %Nn, and set the subnet, like '10.%N1.%M5.%M6/16'; set a whole network address (not a specific IP) for getting the IP autocompleted in that network with bits from MAC address, this works also with netmasks other than /24 or /16, like '10.0.128.0/17' (but not valid network addresses, for example '192.0.128.0/16' or '192.0.129.0/17' won't get parametrized); set two different parameters, the first for subnet and the second for IP parameterization, like '10.0.128.0/16/17', this results in /16 subnet but IP parametrized in a /17 range (from 10.0.128.1 to 10.0.255.254).
	option anygw_dhcp_start '2'			# First IP in the subnet to be used for DHCP for clients. For example, if the subnet is 10.x.0.0/16 and you want the clients to get an IPv4 from a DHCP pool starting from 10.x.100.2, the start parameter will have to be 100 * 256 + 2 = 25602.
	option anygw_dhcp_limit '0'			# Number of IPs available for DHCP. Use zero for having the DHCP pool ranging from anygw_dhcp_start up to the end of the subnet. For example, if the subnet is 10.x.0.0/16, the start of the DHCP pool is at 10.x.100.2 and you want the DHCP pool to finish at 10.x.127.254, the limit parameter will have to be (127 - 100) * 256 + (254 - 2) + 1 = 7165. Instead, if you want the DHCP pool to go from 10.x.100.2 up to 10.x.255.254 (last valid IPv4 in the /16 subnet) you can just set the limit to zero.
	option main_ipv6_address '2a00:1508:0a%N1:%N200::/64'	# Parametrizable in the same way as main_ipv4_address. If used, the IP autocompletion will fill maximum the last 24 bits, so specifying an IP autocompletion range bigger than /104 is not useful.

## set radio99 as client of access point for internet access, both the following "wifi" and "net" sections are required
config wifi radio99 # you should ensure that the chosen radio name exists, for example with "wifi status" command, likely radio0 or radio1. All the other non-specified options will be taken from the general "config lime wifi" section

config wifi radio99 # you should ensure that the chosen radio name exists, for example with "wifi status" command, likely radio0 or radio1

### Network interface specific options ( override general option )
### Available protocols: bmx6, bmx7, batadv, olsr, olsr6, olsr2, bgp, wan, lan, manual, static, babeld, apbb, client
### proto:vlan_number works too ( something like bmx6:13 is supported ), the VLAN type defaults to 802.1ad but 802.1q can be used specifying it with proto:vlan_number:8021q
### If you use manual do not specify other protocols, may result in an unpredictable behavior/configuration (likely you loose connection to the node)

#config net port5					# Do not put any "." in the section name
#	option linux_name 'eth1.5'			# Put here the actual name of the interface
#	list protocols 'wan'				# Some of these protocols require the relative package "lime-proto-..."
#	list protocols 'static'				# Set up a static IP (both IPv4 and IPv6 supported)
#	option static_ipv4 '192.168.1.2/24'
#	option static_gateway_ipv4 '192.168.1.1'
#	option static_ipv6 '2a00:1508:0a00::1234/64'
#	option static_gateway_ipv6 'fe80::1'


### Ground routing specific sections
### One section for each ground routing link
### With ground routing we mean setups having LibreMesh on a router which is connected via cable(s), eventually through a switch, to some wireless routers running the original firmware in WDS (transparent bridge) Ap/Sta mode.
### Likely you want to configure as many sections of ground routing with different VLAN numbers or different switch ports as many connected devices in WDS mode.
### For a detailed description have a look at https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/issues/443

#config hwd_gr link1
#	option net_dev 'eth0'				# Plain ethernet device on top of which 802.1q VLAN will be constructed. In case of doubts rely on https://openwrt.org/toh/start
#	option vlan '5'					# VLAN ID to use for this ground routing link, use little one because cheap switch doesn't supports big IDs, this will be used also as 802.1q VID on tagged ports
#	option switch_dev 'switch0'			# These options regarding switch need to be set only if your ethernet device is connected to a switch chip. If the switch exists you can read its name (like switch0) in /etc/config/network file
#	option switch_cpu_port '0'			# Refer to switch port map of your device on https://openwrt.org/toh/start to know CPU port index
#	list switch_ports '4t'				# List switch ports on which you want the VLAN being passed, use the 't' suffix to specify the port being tagged, refer to https://openwrt.org/toh/start for correspondence with physical ports


### Proto BGP specific sections
### One section for each BGP peer

#config bgp_peer peer1
#	option remoteIP '192.0.2.6'
#	option remoteAS '65550'

#config bgp_peer peer2
#	option remoteIP '2001:db8::c001'
#	option remoteAS '65549'
