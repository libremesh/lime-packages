# The /etc/config/lime-defaults file contains the default configuration.
# To configure LibreMesh insert options in /etc/config/lime-node or /etc/config/lime-community file, these will override the default ones.
# Interface specific options have to be included in /etc/config/lime-node, if in /etc/config/lime-community they'll cause unpredictable behaviour.
#
# The options marked with "Parametrizable with %Mn, %Nn, %H"
# can include %Mn templates that will be substituted
# with the n'th byte of the primary_interface MAC
# and %Nn templates that will be replaced by the n'th (n = 1..5) network-identifier byte,
# calculated from the hash of the ap_ssid value, so that all the nodes that
# form a mesh cloud (share the same ap_ssid) will produce the same value
# and %H template that will be replaced by hostname
# For setting a specific WAN port, don't set it globally in section "config lime network", set it in interface specific configuration "config net ..." and install the lime-proto-wan package
# For setting the WAN port on the default WAN port (according OpenWrt), just install the lime-hwd-openwrt-wan package and the configuration will be autogenerated.

### System options

config lime system
	option hostname 'LiMe-%M4%M5%M6'		# Parametrizable with %Mn
	option domain 'thisnode.info'			# DNS domain for the L2 cloud it could be something like mycloud.mynetwork.tld, hosts that get their IP by DHCP will also get a fully qualified domain name like hostname.mycloud.mynetwork.tld
	option keep_on_upgrade 'libremesh dropbear minimum-essential /etc/sysupgrade.conf'	# Files defining the list of files and directories to backup when upgrade. Relative to /lib/upgrade/keep.d if no '/' defined.
	option root_password_policy 'DO_NOTHING'	# When configured to SET_SECRET, the root password secret will be configured as specified in root_password_secret. When set to RANDOM a strong random password will be set if root has no password, use this if your firmware is built with the ssh keys inside. DO_NOTHING does nothing, leaving the root password empty (you will have to set it manually or through FirstBootWizard).
	option root_password_secret ''			# This is the password hash as stored in /etc/shadow, it is only used when root_password_policy=SET_SECRET. You can generate the secret with 'openssl passwd -1' to be compatible with most openwrt firmwares, use a strong password with at least 10 numbers and letters, the longer the better!. For improved security use "openssl passwd -6" for SHA512 (or -5 for SHA256) but be aware that not all firmwares support this.
	option deferrable_reboot_uptime_s '97200'
	option deferrable_reboot_ping_target '4.2.2.2' # b.resolvers.Level3.net	# the reboot scheduled by deferrable_reboot, if installed, will be deferred if the ping to this IP is succesful
	option firstbootwizard_configured false
	option firstbootwizard_dismissed false		# When true fbw banner will be hidden.

### Network general option

config lime network
	option primary_interface eth0			# The mac address of this device will be used in different places
	option main_ipv4_address '10.%N1.0.0/16'	# Here you have 4 possibilities: set a static IP and the subnet, like '10.0.2.1/16'; parametrize with %Mn and %Nn, and set the subnet, like '10.%N1.%M5.%M6/16'; set a whole network address (not a specific IP) for getting the IP autocompleted in that network with bits from MAC address, this works also with netmasks other than /24 or /16, like '10.0.128.0/17' (but not valid network addresses, for example '192.0.128.0/16' or '192.0.129.0/17' won't get parametrized); set two different parameters, the first for subnet and the second for nodes' IP parameterization, like '10.0.128.0/16/17', this results in /16 subnet but IP of the LibreMesh routers will be auto-assigned in a /17 range (from 10.0.128.1 to 10.0.255.254).
	option anygw_dhcp_start '2'			# First IP in the subnet to be used for DHCP for clients. For example, if the subnet is 10.x.0.0/16 and you want the clients to get an IPv4 from a DHCP pool starting from 10.x.100.2, the start parameter will have to be 100 * 256 + 2 = 25602.
	option anygw_dhcp_limit '0'			# Number of IPs available for DHCP. Use zero for having the DHCP pool ranging from anygw_dhcp_start up to the end of the subnet. For example, if the subnet is 10.x.0.0/16, the start of the DHCP pool is at 10.x.100.2 and you want the DHCP pool to finish at 10.x.127.254, the limit parameter will have to be (127 - 100) * 256 + (254 - 2) + 1 = 7165. Instead, if you want the DHCP pool to go from 10.x.100.2 up to 10.x.255.254 (last valid IPv4 in the /16 subnet) you can just set the limit to zero.
	option main_ipv6_address 'fd%N1:%N2%N3:%N4%N5::/64'	# Parametrizable in the same way as main_ipv4_address. If used, the IP autocompletion will fill maximum the last 24 bits, so specifying an IP autocompletion range bigger than /104 is not useful.

This value should be ok for the static networks, in which the LibreMesh routers are not moving. If you have a LibreMesh node moving (e.g. in your backpack) consider decreasing this value. A smaller value means that BATMAN-adv will take less time for realizing which links are better, but will generate more background traffic on all the interfaces.

### Ground routing specific sections
### One section for each ground routing link
### With ground routing we mean setups having LibreMesh on a router which is connected via cable(s), eventually through a switch, to some wireless routers running the original firmware in WDS (transparent bridge) Ap/Sta mode.
### Likely you want to configure as many sections of ground routing with different VLAN numbers or different switch ports as many connected devices in WDS mode.

#	option switch_dev 'switch0'			# These options regarding switch need to be set only if your ethernet device is connected to a switch chip. If the switch exists you can read its name (like switch0) in /etc/config/network file
#	option switch_cpu_port '0'			# Refer to switch port map of your device on https://openwrt.org/toh/start to know CPU port index
#	list switch_ports '4t'				# List switch ports on which you want the VLAN being passed, use the 't' suffix to specify the port being tagged, refer to https://openwrt.org/toh/start for correspondence with physical ports
