# The LibreMesh configuration is done by /etc/config/lime-* files, following this scheme:

# 0. lime-autogen - DO NOT EDIT, this contains the applied, autogenerated configuration
# 1. lime-node - node specific configuration (interfaces specific options)
# 2. lime-MAC - node specific configuration (interfaces specific options) - every node reads only it's own lime-MAC, i.e. lime-520000abc001
# 3. lime-community - community specific configuration
# 4. lime-defaults - default configuration.

# To configure LibreMesh 
# - Insert options in '/etc/config/lime-node' or '/etc/config/lime-community' file
# - These will override the default ones provided by '/etc/config/lime-defaults'.
# - Interface specific options have to be included in 'lime-node', if in 'lime-community' they'll cause unpredictable behaviour.

# The options marked with "Parametrizable with %Mn, %Nn, %H", can include the templates:
# - %Mn: replaced by the n'th byte of the primary_interface MAC
# - %Nn: replaced by the n'th (n = 1..5) network-identifier byte, calculated from the hash of the ap_ssid value, 
# 			 so that all the nodes that form a mesh cloud (share the same ap_ssid) will produce the same value
# - %H: replaced by the hostname

# For setting the WAN port on the default WAN port (according OpenWrt): 
# just install the 'lime-hwd-openwrt-wan' package and the configuration will be autogenerated.

# For setting a specific ethernet port as WAN
# use an interface specific configuration "config net ..." and install the 'lime-proto-wan' package

### Wifi backbone AP (edit lime-node or lime-MAC)

# If you want to use Wifi client and AP instead of mesh for building the
# backbone of your LibreMesh network (and you are using Batman-adv + Babeld)
# you will need specific wifi and net configuration both on the client and on the access point

## Set radio99 as backbone access point 
# (not for users connection, specific client configuration reported below) 
# part of the LibreMesh network structure using Batman-adv and Babeld, both the following "wifi" and "net" sections are required on the AP

### Network interface specific options (edit lime-node or lime-MAC) override network general options

# Available protocols: bmx6, bmx7, batadv, olsr, olsr6, olsr2, bgp, wan, lan, manual, static, babeld, apbb, client
# proto:vlan_number - define the VLAN number i.e. bmx6:13
# proto:vlan_number:vlan_type - define the VLAN type (default is 8021ad) i.e. bmx6:13:8021q
# If you use the protocol 'manual' do not specify other protocols, may result in an unpredictable behavior/configuration (likely you loose connection to the node)

## configure the ethernet port eth1.5 as WAN with static ipv4 and ipv6 addresses 

config net port5                                        # Do not put any "." in the section name

#   list protocols 'wan'                                # Use 'wan' instead of 'static' to get Internet connectivity via DHCP
    list protocols 'static'                             # Set up a static IP (both IPv4 and IPv6 supported)

    option static_gateway_ipv4 '192.168.1.1'            # In static protocol, specifying an IP for the gateway is optional. Skip this line if no default route should be added on this interface.

    option static_gateway_ipv6 'fe80::1'                # In static protocol, specifying an IP for the gateway is optional. Skip this line if no default route should be added on this interface.

## (optional) Configure lan1 for connection to other nodes, not for users connection:

config net
    option linux_name 'lan1'
    list protocols 'batadv:%N1'                         # Needs to be specified if the other node is in the same mesh cloud i.e. same ssid
    list protocols 'babeld:17'

## (optional) Configure lan1 for users to connect to, not for connection to other nodes:

config net
    option linux_name 'lan1'
    list protocols 'lan'
