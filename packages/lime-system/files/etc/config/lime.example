# The /etc/config/lime-defaults file contains the default configuration.
# To configure Libre-Mesh insert options in /etc/config/lime file, these will override the default ones.
#
# The options marked with "Parametrizable with %Mn, %Nn, %H"
# can include %Mn templates that will be substituted
# with the n'th byte of the primary_interface MAC
# and %Nn templates that will be replaced by the n'th (n = 1,2,3) network-identifier byte,
# calculated from the hash of the ap_ssid value, so that all the nodes that
# form a mesh cloud (share the same ap_ssid) will produce the same value
# and %H template that will be replaced by hostname
# For setting a specific WAN port, don't set it globally in section "config lime network", set it in interface specific configuration "config net ..." and install the lime-proto-wan package
# For setting the WAN port on the default WAN port (according OpenWRT), no configuration here is needed, just install the lime-hwd-openwrt-wan package.

### System options

config lime system
	option hostname 'LiMe-%M4%M5%M6'                                       # Parametrizable with %Mn

### Network general option

config lime network
#	option primary_interface eth0                                          # The mac address of this device will be used in different places
#	option bmx6_over_batman false                                          # Disables Bmx6 meshing on top of batman
	option main_ipv4_address '10.%N1.0.0/16'                               # Here you have 4 possibilities: set a static IP and the subnet, like '192.0.2.1/16'; parametrize with %Mn and %Nn, and set the subnet, like '192.%N1.%M5.%M6/16'; set a whole network address (so not a specific IP) for getting the IP autocompleted in that network with bits from MAC address, this works also with netmasks other than /24 or /16, like '192.0.128.0/17' (but not valid network addresses, for example '192.0.128.0/16' or '192.0.129.0/17', won't get parametrized); set two different parameters, the first for subnet and the second for IP parametrization, like '192.0.128.0/16/17', this results in /16 subnet but IP parametrized in a /17 range.
	option main_ipv6_address '2a00:1508:0a%N1:%N200::/64'                  # Parametrizable in the same way as main_ipv4_address. If used, the IP autocompletion will fill maximum the last 24 bits, so specifying an IP autocompletion range bigger than /104 is not useful.
	list protocols adhoc                                                   # List of protocols configured by LiMe, some of these require the relative package "lime-proto-...". Note that if you set here some protocols, you overwrite the *whole* list of protocols set in /etc/config/lime-defaults
	list protocols lan

	list protocols batadv:%N1                                              # Parametrizable with %Nn (which depends from ap_ssid), note that this will range between 16 and 272

### WiFi interface specific options ( override general option )

#config wifi radio11
#	list modes 'adhoc'
#	option channel_2ghz '1'
#	option channel_5ghz '48'
#	option adhoc_mcast_rate '6000'
#	option adhoc_ssid 'libre-mesh'
#	option adhoc_bssid 'ca:fe:00:c0:ff:ee'

#config wifi radio12
#	list modes 'manual'                                                    # If you use manual protocol you must not specify other protocol, or your configuration will be broken!

### Network interface specific options ( override general option )
### Available protocols: bmx6, batadv, olsr, olsr6, wan, lan, manual
### proto:vlan_number works too ( something like bmx6:13 is supported )
### If you use manual do not specify other protocols, may result in an unpredictable behavior/configuration (likely you loose connection to the node)

#config net port5                                                           # Do not put any "." in the section name
#	option linux_name 'eth1.5'                                          # Put here the actual name of the interface
#	list protocols 'wan'                                                # Some of these protocols require the relative package "lime-proto-..."

### Ground routing specific sections
### One section for each ground routing link
### With ground routing we mean setups having Libre-Mesh on a router which is connected via cable(s), eventually through a switch, to some wireless routers running the original firmware in WDS (transparent bridge) Ap/Sta mode.
### Likely you want to configure as many sections of ground routing with different vlan numbers or different switch ports as many connected devices in WDS mode.
### For a detailed description have a look at http://libre-mesh.org/projects/libre-mesh/wiki/Ground_routing

#config hwd_gr link1
#	option net_dev 'eth0'                                               # Plain ethernet device on top of which 802.1q vlan will be constructed. In case of doubts rely on wiki.openwrt.org
#	option vlan '5'                                                     # Vlan id to use for this ground routing link, use little one because cheap switch doesn't supports big ids, this will be used also as 802.1q vid
#	option switch_dev 'switch0'                                         # These options regarding switch need to be set only if your ethernet device is connected to a switch chip. If the switch exists you can read its name (like switch0) in /etc/config/network file
#	option switch_cpu_port '0'                                          # Refer to switch port map of your device on wiki.openwrt.org to know CPU port index
#	list switch_ports '4'                                               # List switch ports on which you want the vlan being passed, refer to wiki.openwrt.org for correspondence with physical ports

### Proto BGP specific sections
### One section for each BGP peer

#	option remoteAS '65550'

#config bgp_peer peer2
