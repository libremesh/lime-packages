## Voucher and Captive Portal solution for community networks

*ALPHA Software, don't use in production*

This tool allows an administrator to manage a voucher system to get through the gateway.

It could be used in a community that wants to share an Internet connection and for that the user's pay a fraction each, but needs the payment from everyone. So the vouchers allows to control the payments via the control of the access to Internet.

## Features

This are the currently implemented features:
  * Runs directly from the OpenWRT/LEDE router: no need for extra hardware
  * Integrates it's administration with Ubus
  * Has a command-line interface for listing, creating and removing vouchers
  * Voucher database is shared among nodes in the network

All planned features are accesible at: https://github.com/libremesh/pirania/issues
