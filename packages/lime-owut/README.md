# lime-owut

A script to add LibreMesh package repositories to owut build requests (available since openwrt-24.10.0).

## Description
To request a firmware build, owut ask it to an asu server (online imagebuilder) [0].
This package by default instructs owut to use an asu instance [1] which allows adding feeds from libremesh.
A source code with these changes to allow libremesh repositories within asu can be found at note [2].

**owut**, OpenWrt Upgrade Tool, [3] _"is command line tool that upgrades your router's firmware. It creates custom images of OpenWrt using the sysupgrade server and installs them, retaining all of your currently installed packages and configuration."_

In LibreMesh, it can be used to update the libremesh and openwrt packages:
- while remaining with the same version of openwrt (like in the example below)
- when updating to a newer version of openwrt, whether it is a minor update (e.g., 24.10.2 -> 24.10.3) or a major update (24.10.2 -> 25.xx.xx).

**Note**: updating between major releases of OpenWrt is generally only “officially supported” between one major release and the next (i.e., 24.10.2 -> 26.xx.xx may work but is not officially supported).

## Notes
This package may be deprecated in the future, since it adds repo_feeds and repo_keys from libremesh
And the ability to use additional feeds, within /etc/(opkg|apk), could perhaps be added to the core of owut itself.
